# Simulations-Double-Source-Gravitational-Lensing
The simulations of gravitational lens systems are generated using the package Lenstronomy. This package support different types of lens models, light profiles of source and lens, point source options, imaging data information, noise properties of the data (PSF &amp; pixelised convolution),  and image simulations. These tools can be used to simulate systems with multiplane lensing in which there is more than one deflector.
